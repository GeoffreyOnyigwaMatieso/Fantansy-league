# Fantasy League API

This Fantasy League API is built using **Java Spring Boot** with **PostgreSQL** as the database. It is designed to provide a robust backend for managing a fantasy sports league, including functionality for creating teams, managing players, assigning scores, and tracking league standings. This API is RESTful, ensuring easy integration with frontend applications or other services.

## Features
- **Team Management**: Create, update, and delete fantasy teams.
- **Player Management**: Add players to teams, update player details, and remove players.
- **Scoring System**: Manage scores for players and teams based on performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Spring Boot**: For building the API.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the relational database to store all league, team, and player data.
- **Hibernate**: For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- **Maven**: For dependency management.
